# Budget Planner App. Technical Case Study

## Objective

Build a financial planning prototype feature for an existing fintech web app that allows users:

1. To add, edit, and delete a monthly budget
2. To make monthly budget entries (enter, change & delete expenses)
3. To have a dashboard with a total balance after costs and monthly payments.

## Scenario

You're working for a fintech company preparing to launch a new financial planning feature in its
web app. User research showed that this is its most needed feature and generated useful
insights into how the company would like it to work. Together you and your teammate need to design
and launch this new feature in a two-week sprint.

## Project Duration & Scope

Produce two iterations over a two-week sprint.

## Project Deliverables

- User flow diagram
- Low-fidelity prototype
- Implementation plan
- Feasibility and scoping documentation
- High-fidelity prototype
- Code repository with launch history
- QA test documentation
- Final prototype
- Final deployed feature (live)
- Project case study

## Feature User Stories

The following is a list of user stories for the new financial planning feature:

- As a user, I want to be able to add, edit, and delete a monthly budget
- As a user, I want to make monthly budget entries (enter, change & delete expenses)
- As a user, I want to be able to see the total balance after expenses and monthly expenses.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
